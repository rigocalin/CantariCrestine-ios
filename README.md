Worship songs for iOS
================

This is an app for iOS. It is for worshippers to view the song lyrics on their iOS devices. It is under development and available in App Store.

On starting every time, it attempts to fetch latest songs from the repository. 
The downloads contains a large series of Romanian Christian hymns and worship songs used in Romanian Baptist churches. 
After downloading, the songs are available for you to search and or open one of the songs from the list.

View of the lyrics displayed can be changed with respect to text size, style, and type. You may also set the colour for primary language and secondary language.

While worshipping you can set the screen to be awake such that there won't be a need to touch the device often.

Worship songs uses [OpenLp](http://openlp.org) database schema. 

This project is based on [this one](https://github.com/crunchersaspire/worshipsongs-ios) but with different DB's.
